Digital Image Processing Assignments

# Assignments

1. NumPy questions. Answer the [questionaire](https://github.com/tfvieira/digital-image-processing/blob/main/src/numpy_tutorial/readme.md) about NumPy. Answered [here](https://github.com/Vangasse/NumPyTutorial).
1. Submit one function for each of the following tasks (each function receives two images I_a and I_b as inputs):
    1. Computes the subtraction between the two images to locate differences between them, such as finding a dislocated coin.
    1. Implements logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
    1. Implements A union B in grayscale (using max operator).
1. Implement [image stitching](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/17/image-stitching-with-opencv-and-python/) on images ['ic1.png', 'ic2.png', 'ic3.png', 'ic4.png'] to generate one panorama image 'ic.png'.
1. (Optional) Get acquainted with codes in Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of "Mastering OpenCV 4 with Python".
